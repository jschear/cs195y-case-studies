Logic - Open Qestions 

Hotel	
	not one ordering per lock, one global ordering and each lock has a subset of keys
	could a room have no Keys??

	fun NextKey -- ambiguity in the multiplicity of the return 


	init.first

	design point: why not use a sequence of keys per room? the global ordering is weird
