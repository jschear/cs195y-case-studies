Logic - Open Qestions 

---HOTEL---

not one ordering per lock, one global ordering and each lock has a subset of keys
could a room have no Keys??

fun NextKey -- ambiguity in the multiplicity of the return 

init.first -- how do we know that this is Time's first, not keys?

design point: why not use a sequence of keys per room? the global ordering is weird

does this handle multiple guests getting keys to a room.

dot in pred name - refresher?

Standard vs. Event-based
	frame conditions less elegant but only have to happen once
		the frame condition fall in traces, which seems like a better choice of model 
	better for visualization, more object-oriented - might be a better model of the world
